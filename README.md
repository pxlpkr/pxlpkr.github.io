**Crosswordle**
It's Wordle, but green letters spawn new Wordles.
The game ends once no more words can spawn and all words are filled.

Info:
    Gray letters are not in any words.
    Yellow letters are in the selected word.
    Blue letters are not in the selected word, but are in one of the others.
Rules:
    You cannot use gray or blue letters, if any exist.
    You must use all discovetred yellow letters.
    You cannot guess a word that has already been solved somewhere else.
