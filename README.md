**Crosswordle**
It's Wordle, but green letters spawn new Wordles.
The game ends once no more words can spawn and all words are filled.

>   Gray letters are not in any words.<br>
>   Yellow letters are in the selected word.<br>
>   Blue letters are not in the selected word, but are in one of the others.<br>
Rules:<br>
>   You cannot use gray or blue letters, if any exist.<br>
>   You must use all discovetred yellow letters.<br>
